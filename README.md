# Hand Recognition Model

## Description
This project implements a hand recognition model using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately identify and classify hand gestures. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and recognize patterns in images of hands. 

### Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Trained on a diverse dataset of hand gesture images, including various poses and orientations for robustness.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract features, with fully connected layers for classification.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization are employed to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Capable of real-time gesture recognition, suitable for applications in sign language interpretation and gesture-based control systems.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Keras**: For simplifying the model-building process.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks such as resizing and normalization.

## Installation
To run this model, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
